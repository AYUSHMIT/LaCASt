# Contributing to LaTeX-Grammar
## Rules

1. We are working with Abdou's JAR, which is not public yet. It is strictly **_prohibited to upload or share_**  this JAR with other people (even with other contributers). 
2. Only Abdou is allowed to handout the JAR. If you want to be a contributor contact [Howard Cohl](https://github.com/HowardCohl) and Abdou to ask for the permission.

## How to contribute
Once you have the JAR take a look to the [open Issues](https://github.com/TU-Berlin/latex-grammar/issues) to see what needs to be done. (more detailled advices will follow)
