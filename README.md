# From LaTeX to CAS

# Rules
1. We are working with [Abdou's](https://github.com/abdouyoussef) JAR, which is not public yet. It is strictly **_prohibited to upload or share_**  this JAR with other people (even with other contributers). 
2. Only [Abdou](https://github.com/abdouyoussef) is allowed to handout the JAR. If you want to be a contributor contact [Howard Cohl](https://github.com/HowardCohl) and [Abdou Youssef](https://github.com/abdouyoussef) to ask for the permission.

## How to contribute<a name="contribute"></a>
Abdou has uploaded the MLP.zip file. Unzip it and follow the instructions to run it. Besides the README you will find a guide called _"Software usage guide"_. Take a look to both documents as well. Abdou also provides a documentation (javadoc) for his project. How to import this doc depends on your IDE, but of course it is possible to work with it in a common browser anyway (start with index.html).

The [LaTeX2CAS.pdf](https://github.com/TU-Berlin/latex-grammar/blob/master/LaTeX2CAS.pdf) is also worth mentioning. It gives us an example of our goal (Jacobi Polynomial in LaTeX to a CAS).

For precise tasks, take a look to the [issues](https://github.com/TU-Berlin/latex-grammar/issues) and [projects](https://github.com/TU-Berlin/latex-grammar/projects).
